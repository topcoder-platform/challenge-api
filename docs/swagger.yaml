    ## Pagination

    - Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 20 items by
    default.

    - You can specify further pages with the `page` parameter.

    - You can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `perPage`
    parameter.

    - Pagination response data is included in http headers.

    - By default, the response header contains links with `next`, `last`,
    `first`, `prev` resource links.


    ## Access levels

    - M2M token is supported, all non-public-accessed endpoint can be accessed
    using M2M token with proper scopes.

    - Only admins and copilots can create/update an entity.

    - Copilots can **only** update entities they have created. (eg. copilot A
    cannot update a challenge created by copilot B)

    - Non-admin users can access challenges with groups only if they belong to
    any of the groups

    - It will be considered as admin user if using valid M2M token(having read
    challenge scope) to list challenges or retrieve challenge by id

    - Users can access attachments of a challenge only when the user can access the challenge itself.
